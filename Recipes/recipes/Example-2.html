    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>I wanted the richness of long-simmered chicken stew, but without the fuss of using a whole chicken.
        This compromise, using boneless skinless chicken thighs with bone-in chicken breast</p>


    <h4>Ingrediants</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
        <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®) and select the Saute
            function. Cook onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until
            the vegetables are soft and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the
            lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions;
            set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Mash butter with the flour to make a smooth paste; set aside.</li>
        <li>Cover pot with the lid, leaving the steam vent open. Select Slow Cooker function and simmer on Low, covered,
            until dumplings are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.
            A skewer inserted in the center of a dumpling should come out clean.</li>
    </ol>
